### Kia ora, I'm Farrel 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer currently based in Dunedin, New Zealand - but I'm a happy traveller ✈️.
Learning and improving are important for me - both in tech and learning to be a better human 💭.

#### Tools and focus 🧰

I have experience including `HTML/CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, `React`, `Express`, and `TailwindCSS`, and I'm constantly discovering new & interesting tech.
Next on my list to learn: `GraphQL`, `NextJS`, `React Native`, `ChakraUI`.  

#### Fun facts ❔

- Kiwi, but have lived in Europe and fluent in German 🇩🇪
- Enjoy baking (handcrafted bread & cake are the best)
- Love the outdoors and running
